The linoleic acid can also aid in eczema treatment. Studies suggest that Grape Seeds constitute anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-histamine, anti-aging, anti-allergic, antimicrobial, and adaptogenic activity. <\/p><p><strong>Virgin Ucuuba Butter<\/strong><br\/>Ucuuba butter is ultra rich in Lauric, Myristic and Palmitic acid - crucial in healthy cell development, regulation of the immune system and maintenance of healthy skin and hair. <\/p><p>Ucuuba Butter is said to have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties and is ideal for treating acne, eczema and dry or irritated skin. Exceptionally rich in essential fatty acids, Ucuuba Butter is considered to have anti-aging properties and can be used to replenish tone and moisture to dry and mature skin. <\/p><p><strong>Virgin Andiroba Oil<\/strong><br\/>It has healing, anti-inflammatory, and insect repelling properties that are attributed to the presence of limonoids. Known to promote skin healing after injury and to activate the growth of new skin cells. It is considered to be an effective treatment for several chronic skin conditions including acne, dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis as well as blemishes like wrinkles and age spots. Andiroba oil is also widely used as a massage oil to help treat arthritis, rheumatism and other muscle pain.<\/p><p><strong>Lemon Peel Oil<\/strong><br\/>Lemon peel contains the important essential oil limonene along with citral, flavonoids, more than 44 different flavone glycosides, citric and other plant acids. It's a rich source of pectins, phenols, and hydroxycinnamates. One of the most prominent uses for lemon peel oil is for the skin as it is incredibly nourishing. It can be used alone as a gentle cleaning agent that will effectively unclog your pores and clear away the free radicals, dirt, and oil that tends to get muddled on the skin.<\/p><p><strong>Organic Rosemary Leaf Extract<\/strong><br\/>Rosemary leaf extract is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and skin toning properties. When used externally, it is very helpful for skin irritations like eczema and joint problems like arthritis.Used externally Rosemary Oil can help soothe the stomach and relieve pain from indigestion, menstrual cramps or other difficulties. It has also been reported to speed healing of wounds and bruises.<\/p><p><strong>Organic Sunflower Seed Oil<\/strong><br\/>Used topically to improve dry skin and treat skin irritations. Being rich in nutrients and antioxidants, it is widely used for medicinal and cosmetic purposes and is found to be effective against acne, eczema, inflammation, general redness and irritation of the skin.Sunflower oil is also rich in vitamins A, C and D and healthy carotenoids and waxes which form a protective barrier on the skin. <\/p><p><strong>Nerolidol<br\/><\/strong>A sedative terpenoid is a skin penetrant that increases permeability and potentially facilitates cannabinoid absorption when applied topically for pain or skin conditions. Terpenoids and cannabinoids both increase blood flow, enhance cortical activity and kill respiratory pathogens<\/p><p><strong>Wintergreen Oil<br\/><\/strong>Research shows that wintergreen oil has the ability to act like a natural analgesic (pain reducer), antiarthritic, antiseptic and astringent. It’s one of the best sources of an inflammation-fighting compound called methyl salicylate and believed to be one of only several plants that naturally supply enough to form an extract.<strong><br\/><\/strong>Furthermore, Wintergreen is absorbed into the skin quickly and acts like a natural numbing agent, similar to cortisone. It also promotes blood circulation and cools irritation, which is comforting to the swollen skin.<\/p><p><strong>Blue Mallee Eucalyptus Oil<br\/><\/strong>Used for inflammation. Research indicates the analgesic properties of this essential oil. A study in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation applied Eucalyptamint on the anterior forearm skin of 10 subjects, and found that Eucalyptamint \"produced significant physiologic responses that may be beneficial for pain relief and\/or useful to athletes as a passive form of warm-up.\"<\/p><p><strong>Organic Calendula Flower Extract<br\/><\/strong>Possesses anti-inflammatory capabilities and has been shown to calm muscle spasms. Acids held within the oils of this plant have powerful antimicrobial and antiviral effects, especially when fortified with sunflower oil. Studies done for slow-healing wounds and various exposed ulcers, it was found that using calendula-based gels and topical ointments helped speed up recovery rate and healing. <\/p><p><strong>CBD Hemp Oil<br\/><\/strong>Because cannabinoid receptors are located all throughout the skin, CBD has the capability of interacting with those receptors to encourage homeostasis and healing. Easily absorbed, cannabidiol or CBD works to help with inflammation and acts on pain channels to provide relief. Studies also show that CBD can help treat an array of conditions related to the skin.<\/p><p><strong>Copaiba Oil<br\/><\/strong>The most powerful anti-inflammatory ingredient on the planet.

By providing cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) along with other beneficial phytochemicals, Broad Spectrum CBD could offer relief and promoting general wellness without any traces of THC. <\/p><p><br\/><strong>Is it safe to take with other medications or supplements? <\/strong>CBD is generally considered safe to take with other medications or supplements in recommended dosages. However, it’s always important to check with your healthcare provider before taking any new product if you’re under a doctor’s care or taking regular medication. Have a look at our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.solcbd.com\/pages\/pharmaceutical-drug-interaction-with-cbd\" title=\"https:\/\/www.solcbd.com\/pages\/pharmaceutical-drug-interaction-with-cbd\">guide on possible drug interactions<\/a>.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>Why would you choose THC-Free CBD Oil over Full Spectrum CBD?<br\/><\/strong>We advocate for Full Spectrum CBD due to the fact that it is believed that all the compounds, including THC, work together to form what's known as the entourage effect. However, there are certain circumstances when a THC-free solution is needed. These could include, hypersensitivity to THC, contraindications with other medications, or if you are subjected to regular drug screening... In these cases, THC-Free CBD Oil offers a way to get all the benefits of CBD, without any possible traces of THC.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>Why not just go for a CBD Isolate?<br\/><\/strong>A CBD Isolate is a form of CBD in which all the other beneficial compounds found in the cannabis plant have been removed, leaving only pure CBD by itself. While this might sound desirable one of the main reasons why THC-Free CBD Oil is preferable to CBD Isolate is because THC-Free CBD Oil extracts still provide access to all the additional cannabinoids and terpenes that work together with CBD to make it effective. Studies have shown that these compounds can increase both bioavailability and potency when working together. Additionally, these additional compounds can also act as their own individual therapeutic agents that may offer different benefits than those provided by CBD alone.<br\/><br\/><strong>Is there any alcohol in this tincture?<br\/><\/strong>No, our tinctures are made with a blend of organic oils and phytocannabinoid-rich hemp extract.<br\/><br\/><strong>How many servings are there per bottle?<\/strong><br\/>Each tincture contains about 30 servings.<\/p>","dbtfy_product_tabs_image_link":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_html":"","visibility":"product","dbtfy_product_tabs_collection":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_type":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_tag":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_product":"cbd-tincture-natural-0-0-thc"}},"a174d858-fd79-43ab-8d9e-9ef8aa820be0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"0.0% THC- Lab Results","dbtfy_product_tabs_open":false,"text_alignment":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_icons":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_title":"Lab Results","dbtfy_product_tabs_text":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0994\/2802\/files\/CBD_Tincture_Natural_COA-OTONAT900-3006.pdf?v=1675162089\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CBD Tincture (0.0% THC) Lab Results\">Click here to view Lab Results for our CBD Tincture (0.0% THC)<\/a><\/p>","dbtfy_product_tabs_image_link":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_html":"","visibility":"product","dbtfy_product_tabs_collection":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_type":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_tag":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_product":"cbd-tincture-natural-0-0-thc"}},"9d2c14cf-e15a-447c-92ae-81d1175d37ad":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"CBG + CBD - Product Details & Use","dbtfy_product_tabs_open":true,"text_alignment":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_icons":"","dbtfy_product_tabs_title":"Product Details & Use","dbtfy_product_tabs_text":"<p>What makes this product unique is the fact that it's not only full spectrum but also contains equal parts of CBD and CBG! <br\/><br\/>CBG often referred to as \"the mother of all cannabinoids\" is normally only present in small percentages as it is very difficult and expensive to refine.
