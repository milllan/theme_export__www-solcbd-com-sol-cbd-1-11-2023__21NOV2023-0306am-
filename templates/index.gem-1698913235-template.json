Specifically what we call HEMP and what we call CANNABIS. <\/p><p>It’s important to note that the CBD molecule from Hemp is the same as the CBD molecule from Cannabis. Many still confuse the fact that these plants are sisters. Hemp contains very low amounts of THC. Many CBD studies have shown an array of medical benefits. <\/p><p>The reason CBD and other hemp-derived compounds works well for so many conditions, is the endocannabinoid system, a central component of the health and healing of every human and almost every animal. The Endocannabinoid system is a central regulatory system that affects a wide range of biological processes like our immune system, nervous system, and all of the body’s organs. CBD helps bring your entire body back into balance, not just one single area like most supplements. <br\/><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.solcbd.com\/pages\/what-is-cbd-cbd101\" title=\"What Is CBD?\">Click here to learn more <\/a><\/p>","dbtfy_faq_page_open_2":false,"dbtfy_faq_page_icon_2":"","question_2":"How Does CBD Work?","text_2":"<p>CBD works as the switch that turns on the regulatory system in the body called the endocannabinoid system. <\/p><p>Did you know that your body produces its own cannabinoids similar to CBD and THC? These endogenous cannabinoids are a part of a system that acts as the “master control” of the body. <\/p><p>That same system is designed to work with CBD! The endogenous cannabinoid system, or endocannabinoid system (ECS), is a recently discovered system of naturally occurring cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptor sites throughout your entire body! <\/p><p>This system in the brain is made up of endocannabinoids and their receptor sites. Endocannabinoids are naturally occurring substances in the brain that activate the same receptor sites as cannabinoids from cannabis. Research has proven the endocannabinoid system is involved in a number of physiological processes that can include appetite, pain, mood, and memory. <br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.solcbd.com\/pages\/how-does-cbd-work-cbd-101\" title=\"How Does CBD Work?\"><br\/>Click here to learn more <\/a><\/p>","dbtfy_faq_page_open_3":false,"dbtfy_faq_page_icon_3":"","question_3":"Can I get high off of CBD?","text_3":"<p>The good news is no, you do not get high with CBD. <\/p><p>THC has a different effect than CBD on your body because CBD is not psychoactive.
